# ThermostatForHeaterController

The overall goal of this project was to create a system in which the microcontroller would read the ambient temperature of the room, take in a value as a set temperature, and turn a light on or off to indicate if a heater needed to be activated. This information would also be displayed in the terminal so the user could press buttons on the board to adjust the set temperature.
